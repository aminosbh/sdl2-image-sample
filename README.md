# SDL2_image sample

This project is a basic sample written in C that demonstrates the usage of the
[SDL2][SDL] and [SDL2_image][] libraries. It uses [CMake][] as a build system.


It could be used as a base for any SDL2 project. Just fork it, clone it and
execute the `rename_project.sh` script. You will be prompted to enter the new
project name, the new executable name and the new git repository, but you can
keep the autodetected values. Finally, just commit and push the result to your
repository.

## Dependencies

- [Git][]
- C Compiler (gcc, ...)
- [CMake][]
- [SDL2][SDL] library
- [SDL2_image][] library

**On Debian/Ubuntu based distributions, use the following command:**

```sh
sudo apt install git build-essential pkg-config cmake cmake-data libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```

**Optional packages:**

- [SDL2_ttf][] library
- [SDL2_net][] library
- [SDL2_mixer][] library
- [SDL2_gfx][] library

```sh
sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev
```

## Build instructions

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://gitlab.com/aminosbh/sdl2-image-sample.git
cd sdl2-image-sample

# Create a build folder
mkdir build
cd build

# Build
cmake ..
make

# Run
./sdl2-image-sample
```

***Note:*** To use SDL2_ttf, SDL2_net, SDL2_mixer or SDL2_gfx, you should
uncomment some instructions in the CMakeLists.txt file and re-execute the
`make` command.
